# ceres-db

**The memory bank for Ceres.**

This part of the project handles how we store the information we find. It uses a tool called **pgvector** to help Ceres understand the meaning of data, not just the words.

### What it does
* **Stores Data:** Keeps all the harvested information safe in a database.
* **Smart Search:** Uses "vector" technology to make searching for data much faster and more accurate.
* **Organizes Info:** Makes sure everything is tidy so other Ceres tools can find what they need.
