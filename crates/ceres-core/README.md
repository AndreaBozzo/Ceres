# ceres-core

**The heart of the Ceres engine.**

`ceres-core` is the central part of the project. It contains the basic rules and building blocks that all other parts of Ceres need to work properly.

### What it does
* **The Foundation:** It sets up the main data types used throughout the system.
* **Reliability:** It manages how the system handles errors so it doesn't crash.
* **Shared Tools:** It provides common tools that help different parts of the project talk to each other.
